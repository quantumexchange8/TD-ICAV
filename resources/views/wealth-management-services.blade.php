                        <p>Our proficiency in selecting associating companies for investment opportunities has permitted us to partner with larger venture capital companies, because mutual capital pools can add unmatched value to companies looking for the next stage using collective knowledge and understanding of industries and markets.</p>

                            <h5>Fund Placement</h5>
                            <p>Through the years it has become apparent that the success of companies is based mostly on funding and the growth stages. We here at TD ICAV know that the target company must be structured to maximize profits and reduce wastage, it must have all legal requirement/documents and all employees at all levels must understand the direction the company is moving in and be moving in the same direction as attracting external funding is a complicate process.</p>

                            <h5>Corporate Due Diligence </h5>
                            <p>Due diligence is imperative in any investment process and can vary in scope and details from one opportunity to the next. TD ICAV is privileged to have an experienced and reliable team able to analyze the particulars of any company we look to invest in allowing us to make the right decision for future investments.</p>
                            <p>Due diligence must be methodical and thorough so that each decision made is appropriate and relevant to the target company. We will look at past and current performance as well as future performance projections and feasibility to implement the right level of investment. Our due diligence process normally lasting 3-8 weeks depending on the company and its respective market. Here at TD ICAV no decision is made without the completion of due diligence.</p>

                            <h5>Mergers & Acquisitions</h5>
                            <p>TD ICAV understand that some companies grow best though mergers or acquisitions of competing companies and we are profusely experienced in various forms of these strategic investment methods.</p>
                            <p>Occasionally mergers and acquisitions are an easier option to gain access to research, technologies, operations, distribution channels or other assets that can aid growth and add value so we have a highly distinguished team of lawyers who are supported by a legal team that over the last over XX years have overseen many large mergers and acquisitions.</p>
                            <p>Having such an accomplished team is indispensable for resolving potential risks and unforeseen hazards. TD ICAV has represented both institutional corporations and privately held companies of varying size in successful mergers and acquisitions.</p>
