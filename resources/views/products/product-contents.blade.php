            <p>Continuous monitoring and assessments of each portfolio are carried out by our investment managers in line with risk profiling. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the ongoing management is in accordance with our expectations, each fund also undergoes an examination to see whether any revisions to the plan have been adopted. </p>
            <p>To the best of our abilities, we also keep an eye out for any deviations from the performance expectations that are outlined within the strategy and compared to the peers. This is done to ensure that the underlying managers do not engage in any actions that might potentially hinder their capacity to deliver continued returns that are adequate. Furthermore, on a regular basis, our investment management staff will carry out a more formal review examination. 
                By investing in asset classes that we believe will appreciate over the medium to long term and withdrawing from those that we anticipate will drop, the process of asset allocation is designed to capture more macroeconomic events. This is accomplished by investing in asset classes that we predict will appreciate. In line with the ever-changing economic cycles and financial markets, our investment management team manages the asset allocation of the portfolio in a consistent manner. This ensures that the various asset classes, including as cash, bonds, and shares, are distributed in an appropriate manner. 
                </p>
            <p>On the other hand, the investment mandate and the risk profile that corresponds to it guarantee that this process is managed in a consistent manner. It is the most efficient method for maintaining the performance of portfolios during particular parts of the economic cycle that asset allocation is the most successful technique. </p>
