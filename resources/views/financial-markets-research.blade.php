                            <p>TD-ICAV understand that some companies grow best though mergers or acquisitions of competing companies and we are profusely experienced in various forms of these strategic investment methods.</p>

                            <p>Having such an accomplished team is indispensable for resolving potential risks and unforeseen hazards. TD-ICAV has represented both institutional corporations and privately held companies of varying size in successful mergers and acquisitions.</p>
